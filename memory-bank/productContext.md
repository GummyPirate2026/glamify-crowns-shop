# Product Context: Glamify Crowns Shop

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Etsy charges sellers:
- Listing fees ($0.20 per item)
- Transaction fees (6.5% of sale price)
- Payment processing fees (3% + $0.25)
- Offsite ad fees (up to 15% on external traffic)

For a small business selling handcrafted items, these fees significantly cut into profits. A $50 crown could lose $7+ in fees per sale.

### The Solution
A self-hosted e-commerce platform that:
- Eliminates all platform fees
- Provides complete control over branding
- Allows direct customer relationships
- Enables unlimited product listings
- Stores all data locally

## Problems Solved

### 1. Cost Reduction
- **Before**: Pay per listing + percentage of every sale
- **After**: Only hosting costs (can be as low as $5/month)

### 2. Data Ownership
- **Before**: Customer data belongs to Etsy
- **After**: Complete control over customer information

### 3. Customization
- **Before**: Limited to Etsy's templates and restrictions
- **After**: Full design freedom

### 4. Scalability
- **Before**: Fees increase with success
- **After**: Fixed hosting costs regardless of sales volume
